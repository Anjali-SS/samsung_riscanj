Shortcut Summary of the SPIKE Debugging Output:
Program Summary:

The program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the result: 5050.
Key Instructions in Debugging Mode:

LUI (Load Upper Immediate): Loads constants into registers.
lui a2, 0x1: Loads 0x1 into the upper part of register a2.
lui a0, 0x21: Loads 0x21 into the upper part of register a0.
ADDI (Add Immediate): Adjusts the stack pointer.
addi sp, sp, -16: Decreases the stack pointer (sp) by 16 bytes to allocate space on the stack.
Registers:

a2 = 0x0000000000001000 (after lui a2, 0x1)
a0 = 0x0000000000210000 (after lui a0, 0x21)
sp changes from 0x7f7e9b50 to 0x7f7e9b40 (after addi sp, sp, -16).
Simulation Control:

The simulation is stopped manually with the q command after observing the instructions.
Conclusion:
The program is initializing register values and adjusting the stack pointer, as shown by the instructions in the SPIKE debugger.
